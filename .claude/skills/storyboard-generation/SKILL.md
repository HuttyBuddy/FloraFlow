# Storyboard & Presentation Slide Generation

When generating full storyboard slides or presentation decks (typically using `nano_banana_2_0`), follow these rules:

1.  **Strict Containment:** The prompt must explicitly instruct the model to fit all photo cards, text blocks, and UI elements *entirely* within the slide boundaries. Nothing should be cropped or cut off at the edges. Use phrases like: `"All photo cards fully inside slide boundaries, nothing cropped."`
2.  **Resolution & Aspect Ratio:** Use `aspect_ratio: "16:9"` (or the requested slide format) and `resolution: "1k"` or `"2k"` to ensure text legibility and clean, sharp layouts. `1080p` is an invalid resolution for `nano_banana_2_0` — never use it.
3.  **Layout Definition:** Clearly delineate rows and columns in the prompt structure (e.g., `LAYOUT: 2 rows. Row 1: two equal columns (E1 left, E2 right)...`) so the model organizes the elements logically.
4. **Reference Adherence:** If replicating or modifying an existing layout, explicitly instruct the model to maintain the exact typography, icon set, card style, and background color.
5. **Timeline Bars:** When visualizing a continuous shot or multi-scene sequence, explicitly prompt for a gradient timeline bar at the very bottom (e.g. `Timeline bar at very bottom: gradient line from left (slow) to right (fast), labeled...`).
6. **Consistency:** Keep the lighting, time of day, and environmental context consistent across the panels on a single slide unless explicitly contrasting states (like a Before/After).
6.  **Complex Storyboards (Film/Video):** When building multi-panel film storyboards, use a structured JSON prompt with strict formatting directives (e.g., dark charcoal background `#1a1a1a`, white 2px borders around panels, specific typography for labels). Use cyan for camera movement overlays, yellow italic for audio, green for transitions. Embed a structured data block below each panel (Shot Type, Lens, Camera Path, Audio, Transition).
7. **Camera Movement Overlays:** Explicitly prompt for arrows and diagrams drawn *directly on the image panels* (e.g., "curved cyan arc arrow showing orbit", "bold downward arrow labeled VERTICAL PLUNGE") to simulate professional director storyboards.
8. **Empty Panels for Re-use:** When you need a storyboard panel that serves only as a structural placeholder (e.g., removing a character but keeping the text/layout), prompt the model for an explicitly empty dark frame: `"COMPLETELY EMPTY dark panel — solid dark charcoal background, NO photo, NO person, NO image. Just the dark background with a subtle dark grey rectangle placeholder outline."`
